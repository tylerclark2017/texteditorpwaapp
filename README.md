# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a text editor app that used Progressive Web Application development, including service workers, Webpack and associated plugins, IndexedDB, and other similar technologies that we have previously used, including Express JS. This challenge was meant to teach us how service workers are integrated into web applications and how they can allow for offline use of applications. 

We also learned how to deploy applications to Render, a service similar to Heroku.

## Disclosures

I once again spoke with my tutor Erik, utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant, and spoke with our teacher, Louis, during office hours, to get help on this project.
